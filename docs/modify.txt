Modification items to stc_diyclock by KazHat

1. Change the character of day of the week.
    Ex. -1-  ->   Sun 
   Add new LED pattern to show 'modified alphabet' for 7 seg LED.
   By this change, easily recognize day of the week even some alphabet's shape is not match the actual alphabet.
   For example, T looks 7, I is 1, W is upsidedown of A and so on.

2. Add smooth function.
    When push S1 button (upper button), stop the alarm and alarm again after 5 minutes later.
    This continues up to 1 hour to avoid alarm forever.
    Push + button (lower button) for stopping the alarm.

3. Back to the original display sequence:  This is my favorite.
    Same as original display sequence, show time -> temp -> date -> day of the week per minute.
    Temp is shown from 20th sec, date is shown from 25th sec and day of the week is shown from 30th sec.

4. Leap year 
    Add to be able to set the year. This information is set to the real time clock IC of DS1302.
    Date information is always gotten from DS1302, then Feb/29 is correctly processed when this year is leap year or not.
    This needs user to set the year, I insterted year setting after day setting.


Thanks,
