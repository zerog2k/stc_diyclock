STC15Wxxx clock ntp syncronisation (WITH_NTP)

original idea and lua init example by onivan (https://github.com/onivan/stc_diyclock-ntp)

requires STC15W408AS cpu with > 4K flash

warning! there should be only one ESP8266 power source, 
so USB-TTL +5V line shouldn't be connected when powered from the clock!

- customize your nodemcu FW at https://nodemcu-build.com/index.php 
  with RTC fifo, RTC mem, RTC time, SNTP modules enabled, 
  download FW and flash your ESP8266.

- customize your init.lua:

  station_cfg.ssid="yourssid" -- SSID of your WiFi network
  station_cfg.pwd="yourpass"  -- password of your WiFi network
  UTCTZ = 5                   -- your timezone (unix TZ) offset
  sync_delay = 480            -- sync once per X mins (480 == 8hrs)
  -- set your static network parameters here
  wifi.sta.setip({ip="10.10.10.110",netmask="255.255.255.0",gateway="10.10.10.1"})


- upload init.lua script to ESP8266 using ESPlorer or nodemcu-uploader:

  pip3 install nodemcu-uploader
  
  nodemcu-uploader upload init.lua

- reboot nodemcu with node.restart()

- check nodemcu running via serial console.
  there should be output #WYYYYMMDDhhmmss# like #120200325141501#
$GPRMC,232231.00,A,,,,,,,170420,,,*27


- rebuild clock FW with -DWITH_NTP
  Makefile also should be updated for large fw size
    TCCODESIZE ?= 8185
    SDCCREV ?= -Dstc15w408as

you can test your nodemcu going to simple web page located
at http://10.10.10.110 (updated once per minute).
first connection to WiFi and NTP can last long, so be patient.
clock will be synced after successfull NTP sync.

please notice, the ES8266 is significantly warm during operation (up to 40 Celsius)
and it can affect the temperature sensor if it is located close to the watch case.
